            <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>First make he meat sauce. Warm the oil and butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat.
                        Add the onion, celery and carrot, and sweat until soft, about 10 mins. Add the garlic, bacon,
                        beef, liver and a large pinch of salt and brown the meat. Add the milk and simmer until the wine evaporates. 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Stir in the tomatoes, stock and bay leaves, bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat so its barely bubbling.
                        Cook, ucover, for three hours (yes, really), stirring from time to time. Add a little stock or water if it looks
                        as if it's drying to out too much -  if using dried pasta, keep the sauce a little more liquid.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Preheat the oven to 180c/350f/gas mark4. To make the béchamel, pour the milk into a pan, add the bay leaf and warm gently
                        while you make a rouc in another pan. Melt the butter over a low heat, add the flour and stir for a few minutes. Add a quarter of the hot milk,
                    whisk in to the roux, the slowly add the rest of the milk. Whisking all the time to ensure there are no lumps. turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
                Add half the parmesan and season with nutmeg, salt and pepper.   </p></li>
                    <li><p>To assemble, spoon a quarter of the béchamel in the base of an ovenproof dish followed by a layer of bolognese and a layer of pasta. Repeat,
                        finishing with the last quarter of béchamel on top of the third layer of pasta. Sprinkle over the remaining Parmesan and dot with butter. 
                        Bake for 25 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</p></li>
